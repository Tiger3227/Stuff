Desciption of the bot 

The bot began as an X-Drive with a sissor lift to allow it to pull itself up the pole, then evolved to a single arm design with no lift. The plan for the X-Drive was also altered due to the limitations of supplies and size.

"We wanted to give the robot the ability to move the arm 180 degrees up and down. If given near-180 degree rotation vertically, this arm could also trow triballs with high accuracy. When on defense, it could sit touching the ball load zone, get constantly loaded with triballs, and throw them constantly into our zone. We'd need to design a way to make it fast and strong, possibly with a rubber band system (just have to make sure our robot doesn't beat itself up too bad with repeated stopping of this high velocity arm!!)"

How to throw something ideas:

Rubber band snaps arm back (Only 90 degrees of rotation)
Motor throws (Too little power)

The issue then becomes how to grab the tri-ball
